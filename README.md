# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Helped my friend Louise analyse past and present KickStarter data to determine if her own Kickstarter will be successful or not.
It was determined that her kickstarter campiagn for a play would be unsuccessful based off pervious kickstarter data, and the amount of money she is requesting.
The data is provided on the attached excel file.

### Challenege
I investigated to determine which month was the best month to start a Kickstarter campaign would be successful. 
I found that that summer months produce the most success.

I also determined if there was a relationship between how successful a campaign was versus the amount of capital needed for the Kickstater.
